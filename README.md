First,I've integerated the youtube official  api v3 with my project within a service.then called this service in the component,and viewed it in the templete file using bootstrap table.
I used the routing concept to navigate between home page and details page.
Then i developed the details page as required.
Then i added a search bar to search in the videos list and finally i added pagination using ngx-pagination.
Thank you very much.
